# Data Classification Policy

## Introduction

This data classification policy details what precautions to take for protecting data with _[company]_ and also within the customer's enterprise. This policy applies to all forms of data storage, data transport and everyone in the business.

### Data ownership and stewardship

All data must have an owner who is responsible for understanding the appropriate risks and implications of the owned data going awry. The data owner is responsible for assigning the classification level of the data and must ensure that it is consistently protected throughout its life cycle up to the point of where the data is destroyed: Data must be protected in a manner commensurate with its sensitivity, regardless of where the data resides, what electronic or printed form it is in, and what technology is used to handle the data._[company]_ is subject to strict regulatory compliance (PCIDSS, Data Protection Act, etc..) and strict internal rules. Likewise, _[company]_'s customers have similar compliance rules that need to be adhered to, and also have a reasonable expectation that their data is treated with the utmost respect by system vendors.
